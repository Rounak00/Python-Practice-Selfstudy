Space exploration has led to incredible scientific discoveries. From landing on the Moon to exploring Mars, humanity continues to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible beyond our planet.

These missions have not only expanded our knowledge of the universe but have also contributed to advancements in technology here on Earth. Satellite communications, GPS, and even certain medical imaging techniques trace their roots back to innovations driven by space programs.

Terrorism is a big danger to peace and safety. It causes harm to people and creates fear in cities and villages. When such attacks happen, they leave behind pain and sadness. To fight terrorism, we need strong laws, alert security forces, and support from people who care about peace and safety.
